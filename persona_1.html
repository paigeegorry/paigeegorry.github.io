	<h2 id="personal">Personal Websites</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://www.kristagray.com/">Krista Gray</a> has an clean and concise personal website. I like how she has a custom font for her name. I like how minimalist it looks with the neutral colors of the background, text, and icons, where the color comes from the images she puts on her site. It is also user friendly with clearly labeled sections.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.devonstank.com/">Devon Stank</a> also has a clean website, but with a bit more going on. I like how each subpage has the same look as the homepage. I like how there is a simple black and white theme from the pictures to the text and icons. I also like how on the front page it immediately directs you on where you may want to go (i.e. contact or re&#769;sume&#769;). </li>
		<li><a href="http://ximenabeltran.com/category/writing-samples/">Ximena N. Beltran Quan Kiu</a> has a similar minimalist style, however I don't like the formatting of her front page. I do like her Writing Samples page because of the small pictures and easy to identify sections. It almost looks like Pinterest.</li> 
		<li><a href="http://www.anthonydesigner.com/">Anthony Wiktor</a> has an amazing site. What I like about this is that there is one webpage with the navigation jumping you down to each section, but it doesn't look cluttered. He has tangible examples of his work and makes it easily accessible to potential employers. What I don't like is his video of himself at the top of the page. It just seems cheesy.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile">Pascal van Germert</a> has a similar minimalist style as the ones above, but adds some color to the mix. I think this is a good example of keeping it simple, but keeping a consistent color palette. I like how at the top of the page there is a simple image, name, and what the website it about, but there is also a black arrow to jump you down to the navigation. Similar to Anthony Witkor, he has everything on one page, which I also like.</li>
