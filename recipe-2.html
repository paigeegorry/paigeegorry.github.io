<h1>Cauliflower Parmesan</h1>

<h2>Recipe by Melissa Clark</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Think of cauliflower Parmesan as the winter analogue to eggplant Parmesan. This fried cauliflower is worth making all on its own, with golden, crisp florets that are impossible to stop eating. But they’re even better when given the parm treatment — baked with marinara sauce, mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese until bubbling and browned. If you’re not a cauliflower fan, this recipe also works with broccoli.</p>

<ul>
	<li>&frac12; cup all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
	<li>3 cups panko or plain unseasoned bread crumbs</li>
	<li>Kosher salt, as needed</li>

	<li>1 medium head caultiflower, trimmed and cut into 2-inch florets/li>
	<li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
	<li>5 cups Simple Tomato Sauce</li>
	<li>1 cup finely grated Parmesan, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
	<li>&frac12; pound fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Place flour, eggs and panko into three wide, shallow bowls. Season each generously with salt and pepper. Dip a cauliflower piece first in flour, then eggs, then coat with panko. Repeat with remaining cauliflower.</li>

	<li>BSpoon a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle one-third of the Parmesan over sauce. Scatter half cauliflower mixture over the Parmesan and top with half the mozzarella pieces. Top with half the remaining sauce, sprinkle with another third of the Parmesan and repeat layering, ending with a final layer of sauce and Parmesan.</li>
	
	<li>Transfer pan to oven and bake until cheese is golden and casserole is bubbling, about 40 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before serving.</li>
