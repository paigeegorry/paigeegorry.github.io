<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>2 &frac14; cups all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>&frac12; teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
	<li>&frac12; cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li>1 cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>2 cups (about 12 ounces) semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips</li>
	<li>2 cups chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
	
	<li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat in the instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
	
	<li>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.</li>
